My name is Cristian Velasquez. I’m an AI automation specialist and
freelancer with over a year of experience building automations using n8n
and designing AI-driven workflows. I’m also experienced in marketing on
Twitter, where I worked with Hypescribe.com and helped the SaaS grow
through content strategy that generated over 1 million views.

I’ve completed the Machine Learning Specialization on Coursera under
Professor Andrew Ng, and I also finished an AI Engineer program focused
on agentic AI systems. I’m passionate about combining automation, AI,
and marketing to help businesses scale faster and work smarter.
